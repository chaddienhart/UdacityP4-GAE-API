## Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Project 

## [Conference Central][3] - [App Engine][1] APIs implemented using [Python][2]

### APIs added in this project 
- getConferenceSessions()
- getSessionsByType()
- getSessionsBySpeaker()
- createSession()
- addSessionToWishlist()
- getSessionsInWishlist()
- getConferenceByTopic()
- getSessionByCity()
- getFeaturedSpeaker()
- For [the full api list][4]

#### Task 1 - Add Sessions to a Conference
The Session entity stores:
- name as a StringProperty
- highlights as a repeated StringProperty (hopefully the session has more than one highlight)
- speaker as a StringProperty
- durationHours as a FloatProperty (I chose float over integer to allow for fractions of an hour)
- type as a StringProperty
- date as a DateProperty
- startTime as a FloatProperty (I chose float over integer to allow for fractions of an hour)
- web safe conference key as a StringProperty 

The session key is auto-generated.
In my implementation a Session is an kind and the speaker is just a string property of the Session. 
I chose to store the conference key in the session entity so that queries across all sessions can be implemented by simply filtering sessions. Also finding all sessions in a conference is just another filter.
Note: that only the conference originator can create sessions.

#### Task 2 - Add Sessions to User Wishlist

Wishlist sessions are stored in the Profile entity under sessionKeysWishList as a list of web safe keys.

#### Task 3 - Work on indexes and queries
The two queries I added and implmented are:
###### query 1: Get conferences by topic
I think this query is useful since I'm willing to travel to a city with a conference on topics I'm interested in.
###### query 2: Get sessions in a city
I think this query could be used if you are in a city with multiple conferences you can browse all the sessions at one time.

###### Solve the following query related problem:
###### Letâ€™s say that you don't like workshops and you don't like sessions after 7 pm. How would you handle a query for all non-workshop sessions before 7 pm? What is the problem for implementing this query? What ways to solve it did you think of?

The problem with this query is that you are only allowed one inequality filter and this query would naturally have two (time < 19 and sessionType != workshop).
You could filter the sessionType to be equal to any of the other types using an OR, but I'm not sure if that works.
I would prefer to do it this way:
You could get the results, as a list of sessionKeys, of the two inequality filters and intersect the two lists.
final list = set1.intersection(set2) 

#### Task 4 - Add a Task
Add a task to set a featured speaker for a conference. A speaker is set as the featured speaker if when a session is added
they have more than one session at the conference. The speaker, and all of the session names are stored in memcache and can 
be recalled using the getFeaturedSpeaker() endpoint.
